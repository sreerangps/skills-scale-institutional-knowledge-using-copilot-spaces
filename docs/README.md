# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for how we run projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement. Whether you're a new team member getting up to speed or an experienced contributor looking for guidance on a specific workflow, these docs are designed to help you navigate OctoAcme's project delivery practices.

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery, emphasizing clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our process is built around five core roles: Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who build and test features, QA teams who validate quality, and Stakeholders who provide input and approvals. Each project moves through a structured lifecycle—Initiation to validate the business need, Planning to create actionable backlogs, Execution to build and iterate, Release to deploy verified features, and Close with retrospectives to capture learnings. Throughout this lifecycle, teams maintain key artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, backlog items with clear acceptance criteria, risk registers, and retrospective action items.

Communication and quality assurance are fundamental to our process. Teams follow regular cadences including daily standups, weekly PM-Product Lead syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates, while maintaining a single source of truth through project boards and documentation. Quality is maintained through comprehensive testing strategies—unit tests for new logic, integration tests for system interactions, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI pipelines. Pull requests are kept small (ideally under 400 lines), include clear acceptance criteria, and require automated tests to pass before review. Risks are actively managed through a structured register that tracks impact, likelihood, owners, and mitigation plans, with weekly reviews ensuring visibility and timely escalation.

The documentation is organized to support both learning the full process and quickly finding specific guidance. Start with the Project Management Overview for a high-level understanding, then explore the phase-specific guides for detailed workflows, checklists, and templates. The Roles & Personas guide clarifies responsibilities and communication patterns for each team member. As you work on projects, refer to these docs to ensure consistency, share them with new teammates for onboarding, and suggest updates when you identify gaps or improvements—keeping this documentation current ensures it remains a valuable resource for the entire team.
