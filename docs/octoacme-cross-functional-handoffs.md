# OctoAcme Cross-Functional Handoff Guide

## Purpose
This guide defines best practices and templates for handoffs between different roles in OctoAcme projects. Clear handoffs reduce miscommunication, prevent rework, and ensure all necessary context is transferred between team members.

## General Handoff Principles
- **Document key decisions**: Capture the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- **Use checklists**: Ensure nothing is forgotten during transitions
- **Async-first**: Document handoffs so recipients can review on their schedule
- **Single source of truth**: Link to existing docs rather than duplicating information
- **Confirmation required**: Handoff recipient should acknowledge receipt and ask clarifying questions

## Best Practices for Effective Handoffs

1. **Schedule handoff meetings**: Don't rely solely on documentation; walk through complex handoffs synchronously
2. **Use templates consistently**: Standardized formats make information easier to find and review
3. **Link to source materials**: Don't duplicate; reference the single source of truth
4. **Highlight changes**: When updating a previous handoff, call out what's new or different
5. **Set clear expectations**: Define what happens next and who owns the next action
6. **Follow up**: Check in after handoff to answer questions and ensure smooth transition
7. **Document tribal knowledge**: Include context that might not be obvious to someone new
8. **Keep it concise**: Provide enough detail without overwhelming the recipient
